kstrings.ml
 has a parameter k set to 3
 main_analysis extracts the kstrings map and then prints it using sexp. 
 The result is:
 (function (kstring list))
 where a kstring is a k-length list of call addresses

 utest.ml
  implements unit testing.
  I dump the output to a file, and then diff against a 'gold' file which is a
  known good version. The original gold file is checked by hand each time new
  functionality is added.
